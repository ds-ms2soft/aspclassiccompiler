I got the Vs2013 version of the solution compiling in VS2022, but I needed to download VS2019 and install the .net 4.0 targetting pack. Then VS2022 was able to build it. I had to update one MVC assembly reference.

Solution builds with warnings, but the warnings look like they are legit (i.e. there before I got here).
